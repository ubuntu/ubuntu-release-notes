:::

These release notes cover new features and changes in Ubuntu 26.04 LTS (Resolute Raccoon).

Ubuntu 26.04 LTS is designated as a long-term support release. This means it will continue to receive security updates and critical bug fixes for five years. With an Ubuntu Pro subscription, access to ESM (Expanded Security Maintenance) updates will be available for ten years. 

See our {ref}`release-policy-and-schedule`.

## Requirements and compatibility

Ubuntu 26.04 LTS requires a 2 GHz dual-core processor or better, a minimum of 6GB RAM and 25 GB of free hard drive space.

You need either a USB port or a DVD drive for the installer media. An internet connection enables you to access more software and updates but you can install Ubuntu without it.
