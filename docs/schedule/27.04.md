This signup sheet is to be used for planning release milestone tasks.

The Alpha and Beta 1 milestones have been replaced with [Testing Weeks](https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-release/2018-April/004434.html), which are organized ad hoc at this point.

| Milestone | Date | Image (Nusakan) Engineering | Checklist Tracking | Announcement Email |
|----|----|----|----|----|
| Feature Freeze |  | n/a |  |  |
| UI Freeze |  | n/a | n/a |  |

| 27.04 Beta |  |  |  |  |
| Final Freeze |  |  |  |  |

When the archive is frozen, all members of the release team are expected to participate in bug fix reviews.

After [Feature Freeze](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/FeatureFreeze), all members of the release team are expected to participate in Feature Freeze Exception reviews in their particular area of expertise.

After [Final Beta](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/FinalBetaRelease), all members of the release team are expected to participate in Bug fix reviews in their particular area of expertise.
